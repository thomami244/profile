    <p>
    I discovered I enjoyed coding by accident in 2021.
    I completed two courses in Java with the University of the People.
    After that, I joined a part-time postgrad full stack Java developer program with Simplilearn/ Caltech (still in progress).
    On returning to Singapore, I joined a fulltime Le Wagon coding bootcamp and started learning Ruby.
